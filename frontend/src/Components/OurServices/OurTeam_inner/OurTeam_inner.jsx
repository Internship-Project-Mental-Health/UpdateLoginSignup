                      <p className="elemen"> A lack of intimacy can be downright painful and studies show a cause of depression and anxiety. A
                          happy
                          and healthy
                          relationship can bring so much joy and help you through the stressful times in life however a
                          troubled
                          relationship can
                          be one of the most distressful experiences imaginable. Few things in life compare to those
                          consuming,
                          intense and
                          oftentimes intrusive and/or obsessive thoughts and feelings.</p>

                      <p className="elemen">Couples counselling isn’t just helpful when things are falling apart. It can be helpful at many other
                          times as well.
                          Sometimes it is helpful when you are taking a new step forward (or backwards) such as moving in
                          together, getting
                          married, having children. Or even when you first start dating someone. Couples counselling helps if
                          you
                          want to do a
                          check in or just make sure you are still in the best possible place you can be at. It helps if you
                          want
                          to deepen and
                          become closer to your partner or make an already great relationship even better with a few modest
                          adjustments. When you
                          are wanting to end a relationship a therapist can help, especially when children are involved.</p>

                      <h3 className="elemen">Relationship Skills</h3>
                      <p className="elemen">Most of us have never been taught any relationships skills. We might have learned from what we have
                          seen
                          in our
                          families, from friends, media, books, internet. But most of us just have no idea what we are really
                          doing. Couples
                          counselling and therapy will teach the necessary skills to be successful in your relationship.
                          Knowing
                          and understanding
                          your needs. Being able to communicate your needs in a way that your partner can hear you. Learning
                          to
                          listen to and
                          honour partners needs and feelings. Relationship skills can be learned by anyone who is open and
                          flexible and willing.</p>
                      <h3 className="elemen">Build a strong, happy, healthy and loving relationship</h3>
                      <p className="elemen">We will not blame and shame either partner but work together to find the problem areas in the most
                          constructive ways
                          possible and our therapist’s will teach you everything we know and can to help you fix it. By
                          working
                          together as a team
                          in this pursuit, we will try to make it an enjoyable and uplifting experience for everyone. Couples
                          counseling will help
                          you:</p>

                      <h2>Our Therapy Process</h2>
                      <p>Your first step is to call us to schedule your initial appointment. We work hard to pair you with a
                          therapist that we
                          believe will be the best fit for you and your current struggles.</p>
                      <p>Your initial evaluation session provides an opportunity for you to build rapport with the therapist
                          and
                          provide them
                          with some background about yourselves and the reasons you are seeking counseling. In addition, they
                          will
                          be able to
                          answer your questions regarding services, confidentiality, and what to expect in therapy. With your
                          best
                          interests in
                          mind, you will decide together what kind of treatment will benefit you the most.</p>
                      <p>At the end of your first session, if you decide to move forward and work that therapist, you will be
                          asked to schedule
                          further appointments. At your second appointment, you will work with your therapist to set goals for
                          your overall
                          therapy experience and then begin working together towards achieving them.</p>
